# Dangermond Fellowship Projects
### Sarah Mandanas
#### A repository of my Python projects completed at the National Audubon Society during my time as a [Dangermond Fellow](https://gis.audubon.org/dangermondfellowship/) in support of the Enterprise GIS team. These projects primarily focus on using Python to support and enhance client-facing applications that were made using Esri software.
